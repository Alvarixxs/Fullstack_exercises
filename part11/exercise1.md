In my third year as a computer science student I learned about object-oriented software. I particularly learned about it through the Java language. We started off by learning some Java basics to utilize classes. We also learned about more abstract class implementations. To finish the year, we worked in a group of three to build a full application (including exhaustive tests) to manage and exposition centre.
When it came to testing we used the library JUnit which allowed us to develop unit tests and framework tests for the whole project. In our case, we chose to set the test in a separate directory called Test, outside of src.
We didn't use any linting plugins in our project. By browsing the web I have found there seems to be many linters to use in Java, some of the most renown are Checkstyle, Lightrun or PMD.
For us, Java didn't imply any building, outside all our working directories. We had a MAIN main which actually started the user interface etc. By what I have seen it doesn't seem like there isn't any building process in this language.
A very common alternative to setting up CI is using the amazon service which has implementation for many Infrasturctures and platforms as service in the cloud.
